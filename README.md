## Installation

Prerequisite: You must have node.js and npm (npm is typically included with node) installed in your local zsh/bash command line interface prior to installing this program. If you do not have node & npm installed, please follow the installation instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/).

Download the source code for the project with a <code>git clone</code> on this repository in your CLI using the URL or SSH link provided in the "code" button at the top of this repository. Then, <code>cd</code> in your terminal to the directory that contains the cloned repo, and run an <code>npm i</code> to ensure that you have all required dependencies to run the package successfully.
  
## Usage
  
To use the program successfully: open a CLI window and <code>cd</code> to the directory that contains the code (specifically index.js) for this program. Then run <code>node index.js</code>, which will then start to ask you a series of questions about your project to be included in your README file. Then, once you answer all questions, the program will then output a README file into the directory you are in labeled GeneratedREADME.md which you can then use for your project.
